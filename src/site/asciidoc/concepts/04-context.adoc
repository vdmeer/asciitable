=== Context

While the paragraph only maintains the text, the paragraph context maintains all configurable characteristics of the paragraph (see above).
The current implementation directly has

* paragraph alignment (default being justified, last line left)
* paragraph format (default being none)
* paragraph width (default being 80)
* line separator (default being `\n`)
* an optional library for dropped capital letters (default being not set)
* an optional theme for a frame (default being not set)

The following characteristics are handled by special objects (one for each), which the context provides access to:

* indentations (for first line and hanging paragraph)
* all margins
* all characters
* all strings
* all character (and target) translators

Additionally, the context provides a number of helper methods for rendering

* different calculations for width, starting with simple text width and finishing with an all inclusive width
* convenience methods to jointly set margins and characters, for the same left/right or top/bottom pairs

The paragraph can be initialized with a given context or plain, in which case it will create its own context object.
Any future characteristics will be added to the paragraph context
